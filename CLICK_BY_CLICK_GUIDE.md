# 🎯 CLICK-BY-CLICK DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

**Your site:** https://app.netlify.com/sites/ai-resume-job-rec

---

## 📺 VISUAL GUIDE - EXACTLY WHERE TO CLICK

### STEP 1: Open Netlify Dashboard

**URL:** https://app.netlify.com/sites/ai-resume-job-rec

You should see a page with your site name "ai-resume-job-rec" at the top.

---

### STEP 2: Find the "Site configuration" Section

Look at the **LEFT SIDEBAR**. You'll see a menu with options like:
- Overview
- Deploys
- **Site configuration** ← CLICK THIS ONE
- Domain management
- Monitoring
- etc.

**Click on "Site configuration"**

---

### STEP 3: Click "Build & deploy"

After clicking "Site configuration", you'll see another submenu in the left sidebar:
- General
- **Build & deploy** ← CLICK THIS ONE
- Environment variables
- etc.

**Click on "Build & deploy"**

---

### STEP 4: Scroll Down to "Continuous deployment"

On the main area (right side), scroll down until you see a section titled:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔗 Continuous deployment
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Under this section, you'll see text like:
"Connect a Git repository to enable continuous deployment"

---

### STEP 5: Click "Link site to Git"

You'll see a button that says:

```
┌──────────────────────┐
│  Link site to Git    │
└──────────────────────┘
```

**Click this button!**

---

### STEP 6: Choose GitHub

A popup will appear asking "Connect to Git provider". You'll see options:
- **GitHub** ← CLICK THIS
- GitLab
- Bitbucket

**Click "GitHub"**

---

### STEP 7: Authorize Netlify (if needed)

If this is your first time:
- A new window will open asking you to authorize Netlify
- Click "Authorize netlify" button
- You might need to enter your GitHub password

---

### STEP 8: Select Your Repository

After authorization, you'll see a list of your repositories.

**Look for:** `Knnivedh/job-rec`

**Click on it!**

---

### STEP 9: Configure Build Settings

You'll see a form with:

```
Branch to deploy:  [main ▼]  ← Should already show "main"

Build command:     npm run build  ← Already filled in
Publish directory: .next          ← Already filled in
```

These should already be correct from our netlify.toml file.

---

### STEP 10: Click "Save"

At the bottom of the form, you'll see:

```
┌────────────┐
│    Save    │
└────────────┘
```

**Click "Save"!**

### OR Try Manual Deploy:

If GitHub connection is too confusing:
1. Open terminal
2. Run: `cd C:\Users\nived\Desktop\dd\resume-job-recommendation-ai`
3. Run: `npm run build` (wait for it to complete)
4. Run: `netlify deploy --prod --dir=.next`
5. Confirm when asked

This will deploy directly without GitHub connection!
