## 🔗 FINAL STEP (1 Click - 30 seconds):

### **CONNECT GITHUB TO NETLIFY**

**I've opened the Netlify admin panel in your browser.**

### **Do this:**

1. In the Netlify dashboard, look for a yellow/orange banner or button that says:
   - **"Connect to Git provider"** OR
   - **"Link repository"** OR
   - **"Set up continuous deployment"**

2. Click that button

3. Select **"GitHub"**

4. Choose your repository: **"job-rec"**

5. Branch: **"main"** (should be auto-selected)

6. Click **"Save"** or **"Deploy site"**

---

## ⚡ ALTERNATIVE METHOD:

If you don't see those buttons:

1. Click **"Site configuration"** (left sidebar)
2. Click **"Build & deploy"**
3. Under "Continuous deployment", click **"Link site to Git"**
4. Choose **GitHub** → **job-rec** → **main** branch
5. Click **"Save"**

---

## 🚀 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:

Once you connect GitHub:

1. **Netlify will automatically build your app** (2-3 minutes)
2. **Your app will go LIVE** at: https://ai-resume-job-rec.netlify.app
3. **Future updates**: Just push to GitHub, Netlify auto-deploys!

## 💡 WHY ONE MANUAL STEP?

GitHub OAuth requires you to authorize Netlify to access your repository. 
This can't be done via CLI - it requires clicking "Authorize" in your browser.

But it's just ONE click, then everything is automatic! 🚀

Can't find the "Connect Git" button?

→ Go to: https://app.netlify.com/projects/ai-resume-job-rec/settings/deploys
→ Scroll to "Build settings"
→ Click "Link repository"

**🎯 GO CLICK THAT BUTTON - YOUR APP WILL BE LIVE IN 3 MINUTES! 🎯**
